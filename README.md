## üöê Van Life App
Van Life is a full‚Äëstack van rental management platform where users can browse vans, save favorites, and book rentals, while hosts can manage their vans and track ratings.

Van Life began as a guided project from the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j) In the course, I built out the UI/UX for login, registration, van listings, and a host‚Äôs dashboard, originally using Firebase as the backend service. From there, I significantly expanded the project by introducing a custom Flask and MongoDB backend and implementing additional features:
* Integrated Chart.js in the host dashboard to visualize van ratings.
* Introduced user roles during registration (host or non‚Äëhost).
* Added features for non-host users:
    * Save and unsave vans, 
    * Book vans with specific date ranges,
    * View upcoming rentals and rental history.

### Future Improvements 
* Replace hardcoded data (review data and host income data) with actual aggregated data from users and rentals.
* Implement additional endpoints so hosts can manage their vans and view/edit incoming rentals.
* Add a map-based search feature allowing users to search for vans by location.
